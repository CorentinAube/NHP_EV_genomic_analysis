## Usage Notice

### Specificity of the Code

Please note that these scripts were developed for a **specific research project** with particular:
- Data formats
- Taxonomic annotations
- Visualization requirements
- Analysis parameters

As such, they are **not plug-and-play** and may require substantial modifications to work with different datasets or research questions.

### Need Help?

If you're interested in using or adapting these tools for your own research, **feel free to contact me**. I'm happy to:
- Answer questions about the methodology
- Provide guidance on adapting the scripts
- Discuss potential collaborations
